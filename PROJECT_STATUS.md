- ✅ Business model validated (pricing proven viable)

### What to Improve
- ⚠️ Need to secure funding faster (ideally before planning)
- ⚠️ Should have team confirmed before detailed roadmap
- ⚠️ Marketing should start earlier (build anticipation)
- ⚠️ Consider hiring part-time consultant for Qualiopi compliance
