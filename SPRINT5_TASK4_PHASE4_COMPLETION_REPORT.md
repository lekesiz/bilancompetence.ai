## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Two Separate Pages?
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different purposes (browse vs manage)
- **Performance**: Lighter initial page loads
- **User Experience**: Clear navigation structure
- **Scalability**: Each page can be enhanced independently

### Why useJobRecommendations Hook?
- **Reusability**: Can be used in multiple pages
- **State Management**: Centralized API logic
- **Testing**: Easy to mock for unit tests
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for API calls

### Why Gradient Headers?
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section identification
- **Branding**: Consistent with design system
- **User Guidance**: Hero section explains page purpose
- **Statistics**: Important metrics visible at a glance

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation

- ✅ Authentication check in layout
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Bearer token in API calls
- ✅ User isolation (can't access other users' data)
- ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive data
