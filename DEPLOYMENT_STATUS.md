## Deployment Timeline

| Step | Status | Time | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| Local build | ✅ Complete | Pre-deployment | Verified no TypeScript errors |
| Git commit | ✅ Complete | 2025-10-22 | Commit a74ba4c created |
| Git push | ✅ Complete | 2025-10-22 | Pushed to origin/main |
| Vercel build | ⏳ In Progress | ~2-5 min | Auto-triggered |
| Frontend deploy | ⏳ Pending | ~3-5 min | After build completes |
| Backend deploy | ⏳ Pending | ~3-5 min | After build completes |
| Smoke test | ⏳ Pending | ~5 min | Verify endpoints working |

---

## Deployment Verification Steps

Once deployment completes, verify with these checks:

### 1. Frontend Verification
```bash
# Visit production URL
https://bilancompetence.vercel.app

# Check for:
- Assessment detail page loads
- PDF download button visible (for COMPLETED assessments)
- Report type dropdown appears
- No console errors
```

### 2. Backend API Verification
```bash
# Test single assessment PDF export
curl -X POST \
  'https://bilancompetence.vercel.app/api/export/assessment/{assessmentId}/pdf?type=preliminary' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# Expected Response:
- Status: 200 OK
- Content-Type: application/pdf
- Binary PDF data
```

### 3. Error Handling Verification
```bash
# Test authentication error
curl -X POST \
  'https://bilancompetence.vercel.app/api/export/assessment/{assessmentId}/pdf' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# Expected Response:
- Status: 401 Unauthorized
- JSON error message
```

## Known Issues & Monitoring

### Potential Issues to Watch
1. **Build Time**: PDF feature adds ~1.5 MB to backend bundle
   - Monitor: Serverless function cold start times
   - Expected: <2 second cold start

2. **Database Load**: PDF generation queries 5+ database endpoints
   - Monitor: Supabase query performance
   - Expected: <500ms per PDF generation

3. **Memory Usage**: pdf-lib creates in-memory buffers
   - Monitor: Serverless function memory
   - Expected: <512 MB per generation

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check Vercel deployment status
# (Requires gh CLI with proper auth)
gh api repos/lekesiz/bilancompetence.ai/deployments

# Monitor application logs
# (Via Vercel dashboard)
# https://vercel.com/lekesiz/bilancompetence-ai
```
