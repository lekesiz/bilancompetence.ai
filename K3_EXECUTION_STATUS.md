## 🎯 What's Been Done in This Session

### ✅ Task 1: Supabase CLI Installation
- ✅ Installed Supabase CLI v2.53.6 via Homebrew
- ✅ Verified installation: `supabase --version` → 2.53.6
- ✅ Confirmed command availability: `which supabase` → /opt/homebrew/Cellar/supabase/2.53.6

**Output:**
```
🍺  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/supabase/2.53.6: 9 files, 40.6MB, built in 1 second
```

### ✅ Task 2: Environment Verification
- ✅ Confirmed SUPABASE_URL in .env.local: `https://ommidwwqqrhupmhaqghx.supabase.co`
- ✅ Confirmed SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY configured
- ✅ Confirmed SUPABASE_ANON_KEY configured
- ✅ Confirmed migrations directory: `/Users/mikail/Desktop/bilancompetence.ai/apps/backend/migrations/`
- ✅ Verified all 17 migration files present

**Configuration Ready:**
```
Project Reference: ommidwwqqrhupmhaqghx
SUPABASE_URL: ✓ Configured
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ✓ Configured
ANON_KEY: ✓ Configured
Location: .env.local
```

### ✅ Task 3: Migration Execution Script Created
- ✅ Created `K3_EXECUTE_MIGRATIONS.js` for programmatic execution
- ✅ Alternative execution approach using Node.js + Supabase SDK

---

## ❌ Blocking Items That Need Manager Input

### 🚫 Item 1: Supabase Access Token (CRITICAL)

**Current Situation:**
```bash
$ supabase projects list
Access token not provided. Supply an access token by running
supabase login or setting the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.
```

**What's Needed:**
- Supabase Access Token for CLI authentication
- Can be obtained from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens

**Action Required:**
1. Manager goes to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Creates new Personal Access Token (or retrieves existing one)
3. Provides token to Claude: `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>`

**Alternative (Without Access Token):**
- Manager can execute migrations via Supabase Dashboard manually (Option A)
- Copy-paste SQL in Supabase Studio web interface

---

### 🚫 Item 2: Database Reset Approval (CRITICAL)

**Current Situation:**
- Supabase database may contain test data or partial schema
- Running migrations on existing schema could cause conflicts
- **Destructive operation required:** `supabase db reset` (WARNING: Deletes all data)

**What's Needed:**
- **EXPLICIT APPROVAL** from Project Manager to reset database
- Confirmation that data loss is acceptable
- Alternative: Apply migrations incrementally without reset (riskier)

**Action Required:**
1. Manager confirms: "Yes, reset the database"
2. Or: "No, apply migrations carefully without reset"

**If YES (Reset):**
```bash
supabase db reset  # Deletes all data and re-applies migrations
```

**If NO (Careful Application):**
```bash
supabase migration up  # Applies only new migrations (if schema exists)
```

---

## 📋 Remaining Execution Steps (Once Credentials Received)

### Step 1: Authenticate with Supabase CLI
```bash
# Option A: Using Access Token
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
supabase projects list  # Verify authentication

# Option B: Using Interactive Login
supabase login  # Opens browser for authentication
```

### Step 2: Link Project (If Not Already Linked)
```bash
cd /Users/mikail/Desktop/bilancompetence.ai
supabase link --project-ref ommidwwqqrhupmhaqghx
```

### Step 3: Decide on Database Reset
```bash
# Ask manager: "Should we reset the database?"
# If YES:
supabase db reset

# If NO (assume migrations are idempotent):
# Skip reset, proceed directly to Step 4
```

### Step 4: Execute Migrations
```bash
cd apps/backend
supabase migration up
# Or use: supabase db push
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Applied 001_create_schema.sql
✓ Applied 002_expand_assessments_schema.sql
... (all 17 migrations)
✓ All migrations applied successfully
```

### Step 5: Verify Success
```bash
# Option A: Via CLI
supabase migration list

# Option B: Via SQL queries (in Supabase Studio)
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
-- Expected: 30+
```

### Step 6: Test Auth API
```bash
npm run dev

# In another terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "TestPassword123!",
    "full_name": "Test User",
    "role": "BENEFICIARY"
  }'

# Expected: 200 OK (not 500 error)
```
