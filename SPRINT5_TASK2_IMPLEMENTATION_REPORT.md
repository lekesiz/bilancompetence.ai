## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Charts**: Using CSS-based charts (no recharts/chart.js)
   - Future: Can switch to recharts if more complex charts needed
2. **Real-time Updates**: Using 30-second polling
   - Future: Can implement WebSocket for instant updates
3. **Analytics**: Dashboard layout fixed, not customizable
   - Future: Can add customizable dashboard widgets

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Customizable dashboard widgets
- [ ] Export to PDF/CSV
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Dashboard layout preferences (save per user)
