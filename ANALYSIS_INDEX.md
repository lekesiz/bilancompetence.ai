## Key Findings at a Glance

### What Works (70-85% complete)
```
‚úÖ Authentication (basic flow, except refresh)
‚úÖ Assessment system (create, list, complete)

```
‚ùå 26-31 API endpoints
‚ùå ~70 React components
‚ùå 133+ test cases
‚ùå Assessment detail page

## Files to Review

### Critical Files to Check
1. `/apps/backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Token refresh bug (lines 193-202)
2. `/apps/backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts` - Empty endpoint responses
3. `/apps/frontend/components/` - Only 2 functional components exist

### Well-Implemented Files
1. `/apps/backend/src/services/supabaseService.ts` - Database layer
2. `/apps/backend/src/services/assessmentService.ts` - Assessment logic
3. `/apps/frontend/lib/api.ts` - API client

## Verification Commands

Run these to verify findings:

```bash
# Count components
find apps/frontend/components -name "*.tsx" | wc -l
# Expected: 2 (actual components)

# Count pages
find apps/frontend/app -path "*/page.tsx" | wc -l
# Expected: 9 (actual pages)

# Count test files
find apps -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.test.tsx" -o -name "*.spec.ts" | wc -l
# Expected: 0 (no tests)

# Find mock data
grep -r "mockUser\|Mock\|mock" apps/backend/src/routes/
# Expected: Found in auth.ts

# Count endpoints
grep -r "router\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\|patch\)" apps/backend/src/routes/ | wc -l
# Expected: ~40 endpoints
```

## Questions Answered

### "Is the project production-ready?"
**Answer**: No. The project has critical bugs and missing functionality. Estimated 3-4 weeks to production-ready status.

### "Why do metrics differ from documentation?"
**Answer**: The documentation was written as aspirational goals rather than actual achievements. Some code may have been removed after initial documentation.

### "What's the priority fix?"
**Answer**: Token refresh endpoint (lines 193-202 in auth.ts). This breaks session continuity.

### "Can we launch with current code?"
**Answer**: No. Multiple critical issues and zero test coverage make this unsuitable for production.

### "How much is actually missing?"
**Answer**: ~55% of documented features are either missing or incomplete, including all 133+ test cases claimed.
