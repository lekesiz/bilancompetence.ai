## 🚨 Known Deployment Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables
- **Severity**: 🔴 Critical
- **Impact**: API calls will fail without credentials
- **Solution**: Ensure all env vars set in Vercel dashboard:
  - SUPABASE_URL
  - SUPABASE_KEY
  - FRANCE_TRAVAIL_CLIENT_ID
  - FRANCE_TRAVAIL_CLIENT_SECRET
  - JWT_SECRET
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (frontend)

### Issue 2: Database Migration
- **Severity**: 🟠 High
- **Impact**: Saved jobs and recommendations won't persist
- **Solution**: Verify Supabase database is properly connected
- **Tables Required**:
  - saved_jobs
  - job_recommendations
  - rome_codes_cache

### Issue 3: France Travail API Credentials
- **Severity**: 🟠 High
- **Impact**: Job search and recommendations won't work
- **Solution**: Verify API credentials are valid and set in environment
- **Required Scopes**:
  - API Offre V2
  - Rome Code Search
