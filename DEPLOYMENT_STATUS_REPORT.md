## 🚀 Next Steps for Production Verification

### Step 1: Verify Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Monitor Vercel deployment in browser
# https://vercel.com/dashboard/[project-name]/deployments

# Expected Status:
# - Frontend build: Building → Built → Deployed ✅
# - Backend build: Building → Built → Deployed ✅
```

### Step 2: Verify Frontend Production URL
```bash
# Check frontend loads
curl -I https://bilancompetence.ai

# Expected: HTTP 200 with Qualiopi module available
```

### Step 3: Verify Backend API Health
```bash
# Check API health endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  https://api.bilancompetence.ai/health

# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

### Step 4: Test Qualiopi Module Routes
```bash
# Test API endpoint for indicators
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  https://api.bilancompetence.ai/api/qualiopi/indicators

# Expected: 200 OK with indicator data
```

### Step 5: Run E2E Tests in Production
- Navigate to: https://bilancompetence.ai/admin/qualiopi/indicators
- Verify page loads
- Verify data displays
- Test status update workflow

## 🔍 Deployment Verification Commands

Once Vercel deployment completes, run these commands to verify:

```bash
# 1. Frontend Health
curl -I https://bilancompetence.ai
# Expected: 200 OK

# 2. Frontend with grep for Qualiopi
curl -s https://bilancompetence.ai | grep -i qualiopi
# Expected: References to Qualiopi module

# 3. API Health
curl -s https://api.bilancompetence.ai/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# 4. Check Qualiopi Endpoints
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.bilancompetence.ai/api/qualiopi/indicators | jq .
# Expected: Array of indicators

# 5. Lighthouse Score
# Open: https://bilancompetence.ai in Chrome
# Run: DevTools > Lighthouse > Generate report
# Expected: All scores > 85

# 6. Manual QA Scenario 1: Login
# Step 1: Navigate to admin panel
# Step 2: Login with credentials
# Step 3: Verify authenticated

## 📝 Issues Found & Actions

### Issue 1: Local Development Environment
- **Description**: Backend dev server failing with missing dependencies
- **Root Cause**: Environment variables not set locally, winston not installed
- **Impact**: ⛔ Local dev server - ✅ No impact on production deployment
- **Status**: Expected and documented in deployment guide
- **Resolution**: Vercel will use production environment variables

### Issue 2: Current Frontend URL
- **Description**: https://bilancompetence.ai serving old static HTML
- **Root Cause**: Old version may still be deployed or Vercel cache
- **Impact**: ⏳ Should be replaced once Vercel deployment completes
- **Status**: Expected - waiting for Vercel build
- **Resolution**: Automatic once Vercel redeploy completes
