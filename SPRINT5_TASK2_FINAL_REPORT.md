1. **Role-based component structure** - Easy to maintain and extend
2. **Custom data hook** - Centralized API logic reduces duplication
3. **Comprehensive type system** - Caught issues early
4. **Extensive testing** - Caught edge cases before production
5. **Clean git history** - Easy to track changes

### What Could Be Improved
1. **ConsultantDashboard E2E tests** - Could add more detailed tests
2. **Analytics library** - Could upgrade to recharts for complex visualizations
3. **Real-time updates** - Could add WebSocket for instant updates
4. **Customizable widgets** - Could make dashboards user-customizable

---

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
- Monitor production for user feedback
- Gather analytics on dashboard usage
- Optimize slow queries if needed
