## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

3. **Validation**: Must validate with 5 beta users by week 6
4. **Speed**: Must hit 8-week deadline for momentum

## ⚠️ KEY RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Funding delays | Start with €50K bootstrap, apply for BPI immediately |
| API unavailability | Use local data fallback, test alternatives |
| Scope creep | Strict MVP definition, no features beyond scope |
| Market rejection | Validate with 5 users before full dev, iterate if needed |
| Competition | Move fast, secure partnerships, build moat via compliance |
| Team burnout | Realistic timeline (8 weeks is aggressive but doable) |
