## 💡 RECOMMENDED ADAPTATIONS IF NEEDED

### If Funding Delayed (1-2 weeks)

**Action**: Start with bootstrap funds, delay hiring, use contractors

```
Reduced Timeline:
- Sprint 1-2: Founder only (80 hrs)
- Sprint 3-4: Add contractor developer
- Sprint 5+: Add full team when funding arrives
```

---

### If Team Member Unavailable

**Action**: Use documented plans to onboard replacement quickly

```
Cross-training:
- Frontend dev can handle backend (documented)
- QA can handle simple dev tasks (documented)
- PM can do dev if needed (documented)
```

---

### If MVP Scope Too Large

**Action**: Ruthlessly cut to MUST HAVEs only

```
Reduced MVP (4 weeks):
1. Auth + basic bilan creation
2. Self-assessment form
3. Simple PDF generation
4. No messaging, no admin dashboard
5. Launch with 3 beta users
6. Add other features in Phase 2
```
