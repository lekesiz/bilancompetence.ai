## ðŸ“¦ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

Push all 12 commits from the local development branch to the remote GitHub repository:

```bash
# Verify all commits are ready
git log --oneline -12

# Push commits to main branch
git push origin main

# Verify push was successful
git log --oneline origin/main -5
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables (Vercel)

Before deploying to Vercel, ensure all required environment variables are set:

#### Backend Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.bilancompetence.ai
SENTRY_DSN_BACKEND=https://...@sentry.io/...
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.bilancompetence.ai
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://bilancompetence.ai
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-RXFKWB8YQJ
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel Production

#### Option A: Using GitHub Integration (Auto-Deploy)
```bash
git push origin main
# Vercel will automatically trigger deployment
```

#### Option B: Using Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

After frontend deployment succeeds:

```bash
cd apps/backend
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...production-db...
npm run migrate
npm run seed:qualiopi
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

#### Frontend Health Check
```bash
curl -I https://bilancompetence.ai
# Expected: HTTP 200
```

#### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  https://api.bilancompetence.ai/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }
```

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Login to admin dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to /admin/qualiopi/indicators
- [ ] Test status update workflow
- [ ] Verify Qualiopi pages load and function correctly

---

## ðŸ”„ Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate (5 minutes)
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible
- [ ] Qualiopi module pages display correctly
- [ ] No 5xx errors in Vercel logs

### Health Checks (1 hour)
- [ ] All API endpoints responding
- [ ] Database queries executing correctly
- [ ] Audit logs being recorded
- [ ] Sentry capturing errors

### Full Validation (24 hours)
- [ ] 10/10 manual QA scenarios pass
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] Zero critical errors in Sentry
- [ ] All user workflows functional

---

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Procedure

If critical issues arise:

```bash
# Option 1: Rollback via Vercel CLI
vercel rollback

# Option 2: Redeploy previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## âœ¨ Completion

Once all verification steps pass, the Qualiopi Compliance Module is successfully deployed to production.
