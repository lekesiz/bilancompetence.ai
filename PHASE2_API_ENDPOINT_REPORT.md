## Implementation Details

### 1. Files Modified

#### `/apps/backend/src/routes/export.ts` (+140 lines)

**Added Imports**:
```typescript
import { supabase } from '../services/supabaseService.js';
import {
  generateAssessmentPDF,

{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "PDF_GENERATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Failed to generate PDF: {error_details}"
}
```

### 3. Access Control Implementation

#### For Single Assessment Export

Access is granted to:
1. **Assessment Owner** (beneficiary_id matches user ID)
2. **Assigned Consultant** (consultant_id matches user ID)
3. **Organization Admin** (user role is ORG_ADMIN)

```typescript
const isOwner = (assessment as any).beneficiary_id === req.user.id;
const isConsultant = (assessment as any).consultant_id === req.user.id;
const isAdmin = req.user.role === 'ORG_ADMIN';

if (!isOwner && !isConsultant && !isAdmin) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    status: 'error',
    message: 'You do not have permission to access this assessment',
  });
}
```

#### For User Assessments Summary

Access is granted to:
1. **Authenticated User** (all users can export their own assessments)

Handled by `authMiddleware` which verifies JWT token.

### 4. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with specific error codes and messages:

| Error | HTTP Code | Condition |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Missing authentication | 401 | No JWT token provided |
| Invalid authentication | 401 | JWT token is invalid/expired |
| Permission denied | 403 | User cannot access assessment |
| Assessment not found | 404 | Assessment ID doesn't exist |
| Invalid report type | 400 | Report type not preliminary/investigation/conclusion |
| PDF generation error | 500 | PDF generation failed |
| No assessments found | 404 | User has no assessments (summary endpoint) |

Error responses include:
- `status`: 'error'
- `code`: Error code (when applicable)
- `message`: Detailed error message

### 5. Filename Generation

Filenames follow a consistent, descriptive pattern:

**Single Assessment**:
```
Assessment_{ReportType}_{AssessmentID_First8}_{Date}.pdf
Example: Assessment_Preliminary_550e8400_2025-10-22.pdf
```

**User Summary**:
```
Assessments_Summary_{UserID_First8}_{Date}.pdf
Example: Assessments_Summary_2c98c311_2025-10-22.pdf
```

Benefits:
- Descriptive: Shows report type and assessment ID
- Timestamped: Includes generation date
- Professional: Follows business document naming conventions
- Unique: Prevents filename collisions

### 6. HTTP Headers

**For PDF Response** (Success):
```
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."
Content-Length: {file_size_in_bytes}
```

These headers:
- Instruct browser to download as attachment (not display inline)
- Provide descriptive filename for downloads
- Include file size for bandwidth estimation
- Properly identify MIME type as PDF

### 7. Integration with pdfService

The endpoints integrate seamlessly with the Phase 1 pdfService:

```typescript
// Single assessment PDF
const pdfBuffer = await generateAssessmentPDF(
  assessmentId,
  req.user.id,
  type as 'preliminary' | 'investigation' | 'conclusion'
);

// User assessments summary
const pdfBuffer = await generateUserAssessmentsSummary(req.user.id);
```

The pdfService handles:
- Data fetching from Supabase
- PDF generation with pdf-lib
- Access control verification
- Error handling and throwing

---

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Compliance
- ✅ **Zero Type Errors**: export.ts passes TypeScript type checking
- ✅ **Proper Typing**: All parameters and returns properly typed
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Type-safe error handling with `as Error`
- ✅ **Type Assertions**: Used where necessary (`as any`) for Supabase types

### Code Standards
- ✅ **Consistent Formatting**: Matches existing codebase style
- ✅ **JSDoc Comments**: All endpoints documented with JSDoc
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with specific error handling
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Query parameters validated
- ✅ **Authentication**: authMiddleware applied to all endpoints

### Best Practices Applied
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Routes handle HTTP, pdfService handles PDF
- ✅ **DRY Principle**: No code duplication with existing export endpoints
- ✅ **Express Patterns**: Follows Express routing conventions
- ✅ **Security**: Proper access control verification
- ✅ **RESTful Design**: Proper HTTP methods and status codes

## Route Registration

The endpoints are automatically available because:

1. Export routes are imported in `/apps/backend/src/index.ts` (line 15)
2. Routes are mounted at `/api/export` (line 71)
3. Therefore, endpoints are available at:
   - `POST /api/export/assessment/:assessmentId/pdf`
   - `POST /api/export/assessments/summary/pdf`

### Active Routes
```
app.use('/api/export', exportRoutes);
```
