---

## Known Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Supabase Authentication
**Issue**: Authentication may fail if Supabase credentials not configured
**Mitigation**: Check Vercel environment variables for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
**Check**: Try creating an account and verify token in localStorage

### Risk 2: CORS/API Connection
**Issue**: Frontend may not connect to backend API
**Mitigation**: Verify backend URL is correct in frontend config
**Check**: Open DevTools Network tab, check API calls are being made

### Risk 3: Database Connectivity
**Issue**: Backend may not connect to Supabase database
**Mitigation**: Verify database migrations ran on Vercel
**Check**: Try creating assessment, verify 201 response from API

### Risk 4: Auto-Save Timing
**Issue**: 30-second auto-save interval may be inconvenient for testing
**Mitigation**: Check localStorage directly to verify saves
**Check**: DevTools → Application → LocalStorage → assessment_draft_*
