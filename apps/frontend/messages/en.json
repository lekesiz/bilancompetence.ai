          "question": "What tests will I take?",
          "answer": "You will take several scientifically validated psychometric tests: MBTI personality test, RIASEC professional interests test, skills inventory, and professional values test. These tests are reflection tools."

          "question": "Will my employer be informed if I use my CPF?",

        {
          "question": "Does the assessment guarantee finding a job?",
          "answer": "The assessment is not a job placement service, but a decision-making tool. It helps you clarify your project, identify your strengths and build a concrete action plan. It is then up to you to implement this plan."
